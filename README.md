## Installation

The latest version of `swmpc` is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/swmpc/id6743818735). I've decided to make `swmpc` a paid app to help offset the many hours spent developing it, as well as expenses like the annual $100 Apple Developer License fee. Of course, you're also welcome to compile `swmpc` yourself from source.

`swmpc` is an universal app, meaning you only need to purchase it once to get it on both macOS and iOS.


## Requirements

- macOS 26.0 or later
- iOS 26.0 or later
- MPD 0.22 or later
