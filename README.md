- [x] Library browsing (search by artist, album, etc.)
- [x] Playlist management
- [x] Control playback from the menu bar
- [x] A beautiful albumart popover for the menubar

- [ ] Create playlists using AI-generated recommendations

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later
- MPD 0.24.0 or later, (using older versions may work, but playlist management will not be available)


## Installation
