- *Intuitive queue management*: add and remove tracks, reorder tracks, and manage your playback queue with ease
- *Efficient playlist management*: create, edit, and delete playlists, as well as add tracks to them

## Installation

The latest version of `swmpc` is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/swmpc/id6743818735). I've decided to make `swmpc` a paid app to help offset the many hours spend developing it, as well as expenses like the annual $100 Apple Developer License fee. Of course, you're also welcome to compile `swmpc` yourself from source.


## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later
- iOS 18.0 or later
- MPD 0.24 or later
