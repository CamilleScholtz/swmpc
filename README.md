## Features

`swmpc` is a beautifully designed and simple yet powerful MPD (Music Player Daemon) client tailored exclusively for macOS & iOS. It supports all the basic features you would expect from a MPD client, and more.

Key Features:

- Intuitive music library browsing: quickly search by artist, album, or track
- Seamless playback controls directly accessible from your menu bar
- Efficient playlist management, enabling you to easily create and organize playlists
- Smart playlists generated with cutting-edge AI (powered by OpenAI or DeepSeek)

## Installation

The latest version of `swmpc` is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/swmpc/id6743818735). I've decided to make `swmpc` a paid app to help offset the many hours spend developing it, as well as expenses like the annual $100 Apple Developer License fee. Of course, you're also welcome to compile `swmpc` yourself from source.


## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later
- iOS 18.0 or later
- MPD 0.24 or later
